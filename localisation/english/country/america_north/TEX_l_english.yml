 # Economic #
 TEX_destroy_the_corporatocracy: "Complete Corporate Destruction"
 TEX_destroy_the_corporatocracy_desc: "These corporations and businessmen are all the same. They want to take away the money of the people through slavery, usury and all the other sins of the book. We, as America's defenders cannot accept this. We cannot let out people ever be slaves to these evil men in suits. It is our duty to forcefully dismantle all the minor corporations present in our controlled states and to make sure the monopolies which existed during the Rockefeller Regime never show up again and haunt the American people."
 TEX_intervene_in_the_economy: "Seize Corporate Assets"
 TEX_intervene_in_the_economy_desc: "We cannot just tell these companies to stop treating people like trash. We need to force them do so. Unfortunately, while this practice might be viewed criticlaly by some economists and politcians, as a country we will need to switch to a more interventionist economic system for the time being with a big amount of state control never seen in American history. But as they say: Radical times require radical measures"
 TEX_develop_our_infrastructure_desc: "We must connect the American nation. The old backward system of infrastructure and roads ultimately led to the failure of the Revolution of 1916 because the cells werent able to actively support one another which enabled the more decentralized corporate militias to destroy our attempt. However, we won't allow this to happen. In order to boost the growth of our economy and our military we will need to reform the roads."
 TEX_develop_our_infrastructure: "Develop our Infrastructure"
 TEX_bail_out_the_corpos: "Bailout the Corporations"
 TEX_expand_worker_rights: "Expand Worker Rights"
 TEX_expand_worker_rights_desc: "The tyranical maniac John D. Rockefeller opressed the workers and regular folk of America for far too long. We will allow the workers more rights at their workplaces and in decision-making so that we can finally free them from the chains, which will also help to prevent them from falling to ideologies like marxism and anarchism."
 TEX_token_worker_rights: "Token Worker Rights"
 TEX_token_worker_rights_desc: "We must make the workers of America see that we want the best of them without actually giving them so much rights that they would destroy the economy with their own intentions and desires of so called liberation. Therefore, we will make a small show of humanity by increasing their abilities at the worker place but in a very limited amount. The goal of this is to prevent their fall to ideologies like marxism."
 TEX_fixing_the_economy: "Restrengthening Our Economy"
 TEX_fixing_the_economy_desc: "Rockefeller's administration has severely weakened our economy. We are still way better off than some of the other warlords, but we need to rebuild and regain our strength if we hope to survive."
 TEX_cooperate_with_loyal_corporations: "Control The Corporations"
 TEX_cooperate_with_loyal_corporations_desc: "Not every company is a branch of Ford Motors! We will search for valuable corporations willing enough to cooperate with our government and seek to invest as best as we can into them, so that our blast furnaces can fire off again!"
 TEX_emergency_industrialization: "Emergency Industrialisation"
 TEX_emergency_industrialization_desc: "We will implement a number of laws making economic reform easier as well as to open a number of new state-owned factories. For the people to find jobs we need to put more effort into creating spaces where they can get those jobs. However, we also need to take away a few liberties to speed these reforms up, but fret not, this will be temporary..."
 TEX_hike_the_population_tax: "Hike the Population Tax"
 TEX_hike_the_population_tax_desc: "A painful action, but it must be done. If we wish to keep funding our economic goals we need to gain a greater budget, and to do that is to allocate such a burden to our people, as is increasing the tax. Alas, we will come out great again!"
 TEX_increase_working_hours: "Mandatory Labor"
 TEX_increase_working_hours_desc: ""
 TEX_import_mexican_labor: "Import Mexican Labor"
 TEX_import_mexican_labor_desc: "Mi Casa es tu Casa! We need to invite Mexican workers in order to boost our fragile industry that is lacking a proper workforce after the events following the assasination. We will give them visas and allow them to work here. We will promise them good food since thats what Mexicans like, but we wont give it to them. They are a cheap workforce, screws in our machine. And we will use them for America's return."
 TEX_expand_our_research_capabilities: "Expand our Research Capabilites"
 TEX_expand_our_research_capabilities_desc: "We need to expand our laboratories and invest in companies that make new products both for our military and for the civilian population. We are lacking technologically compared to the other warlords due to our geographical location. In order to fight against this, we need to heavily invest into expanding our education system, our labs and we need to support the engineers of America at being the best versions of themselves."

These many children of Satan have many faces, from the unassuming to the radical. From the socialists who promise a utopia if you give up your homes and swear off your God, to the cultists who promise you everything if you worship theirs. The only way to save our world is to stand together, and as the children, the hands of God, break our shackles and rid it of the Devil." -John Frank Norris, political representative of the Texas Baptist Church."
